# Local Climate Zone Classification Using a Multi-Scale, Multi-Level Attention Network
Authors: [Minho Kim](https://minho.me), Doyoung Jeong, [Yongil Kim](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yongil-Kim-2)


The code is provided for the Multi-Scale, Multi-Level Attention Network (MSMLA) proposed in [Local climate zone classification using a multi-scale, multi-level attention network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271621002537) accepted in ISPRS J. 

The model is shown below:

All experiments were trained from scratch and were performed using an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU at 3.40 GHz and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) with 8 GB of memory. Python 3.7.9 was used with Tensorflow 2.3.0. For training hyperparameters, an early stop of 15 epochs, a learning rate of 0.002, and a decay factor of 0.004 were used. The adaptive moment estimation (adam) optimizer was chosen to minimize the cross-entropy loss function. Filter weights were initialized using “He normal” initialization.

Requirements
---------------------
- python=3.7.9
- tensorflow-gpu=2.3
- tensorflow-addons
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas
- albumentations (pip)

Usage
---------------------
1. Install a new conda environment
```
$ conda env create --name msmla --file environment.yml
```
2. Activate the new environment and navigate to the "src" folder
```
$ conda activate msmla 
$ cd src
```
3. Download train, test, validation sample .h5 files. The .rtf text file in *LCZ_MSMLA/data* folder contains a download link. Make sure to move the .h5 files into the *LCZ_MSMLA/data* folder.

4. Run the train.py code
```
$ python main.py --path /YOUR/LOCAL/DIRECTORY/LCZ_MSMLA # Only change /YOUR/LOCAL/DIRECTORY without " "
```

LCZ Classification
